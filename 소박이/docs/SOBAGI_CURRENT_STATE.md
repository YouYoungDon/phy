# Sobagi — Current State

**Role:** Single operational source of truth. Describes what is currently true — not what was built, not what is planned.
**Update:** When system status changes. Not when code changes internally.

---

## Documentation Hierarchy

```
SOBAGI_PHILOSOPHY.md          — emotional anchor, tone rules, anti-patterns (rarely changes)
          ↓
SOBAGI_CURRENT_STATE.md       ← you are here
          ↓
SOBAGI_NEXT_PRIORITIES.md     — ordered work queue
          ↓
docs/superpowers/specs/       — approved design specs (reference after implementation)
docs/superpowers/plans/       — implementation plans (reference after completion)
          ↓
docs/archive/                 — dated snapshots, superseded plans (historical only)
          ↓
code                          — final truth of what runs
```

**Conflict resolution:** higher in the hierarchy wins.
If code contradicts this document, update this document.
If a plan contradicts PHILOSOPHY, stop and surface it to the product owner.
Archived docs are never authoritative — never use them to override current state.

## Update Rules

**Update when:**
- A system moves between status categories (planned → partial → complete)
- A new known issue is discovered, or an existing one is resolved
- Storage keys are added, removed, or renamed
- A handoff is written (replaces `## Latest Handoff`)

**Do NOT update when:**
- Code changed internally with no status change
- A system was refactored but still does the same thing
- You want to log what changed (use git history and commit messages for that)

**What does NOT belong here:**
- Feature specs → `docs/superpowers/specs/`
- Implementation plans → `docs/superpowers/plans/`
- Historical snapshots → `docs/archive/`
- Detailed design philosophy → `SOBAGI_PHILOSOPHY.md`
- Work queue ordering → `SOBAGI_NEXT_PRIORITIES.md`
- "As of date X" accumulation — this document has no date log, only current truth

**What to do with completed work:**
Summarize in one row of the System Status table. The detail lives in the spec/plan file and commit history. Do not expand this document with narrative summaries of what was done.

**What to do with outdated priorities:**
Strike through in SOBAGI_NEXT_PRIORITIES.md, then move to "Recently completed." Do not leave finished tasks as active in this document.

## Latest Handoff

**Agent:** QA
**Date:** 2026-05-17
**Groups reviewed:** Group F (Photocard)

### What's now working
- All QA-2026-05-16 critical regressions confirmed fixed:
  - `atmosphereService` wired in `index.tsx` — time-of-day tint + warmth overlays, both `pointerEvents="none"` ✓
  - `returnAfterGap` fires correctly — module-level `prevVisitDate` in `useAppInit.ts`, read via lazy initializer ✓
  - `reaction.tsx` title tier-aware — `getReactionTitle(emotion, tier)` with 3 tiers ✓
- Photocard (Group F) confirmed working — dark modal, 1.8s white-reveal, quote fade-in, tap-to-close, auto-dismiss paused while button is visible

### Fragile / surprising
- **Warmth color mismatch** — `PhotocardView.tsx` uses `'#C87941'`; `index.tsx` uses `'#E8C070'`. Fix: `PhotocardView.tsx` line 76
- Early tap dismissal — `photocardModal onPress` is live from t=0; user can close before card develops
- Quote `fontStyle: italic` + quotation marks reads as formal caption, not Sobagi's voice
- Memory strip backing layer recently added (rgba dark warm at 0.14 opacity) — atmospheric, not a UI panel

### What the next agent must NOT do
- Add save/share/capture to photocard — Tier 2 presentation is the product
- Add analytics overlay, card counter, collection grid, or generation pressure copy
- Remove the subtle memory strip backing layer — it's intentional for readability

### Next
Immediate: warmth color fix (1-line). Then copy reviews: `"잘 기록해뒀어요"` → `"조용히 기록해뒀어요"`; `"오늘도 수고했어요"` → observational alternative.

## Storage Keys

All keys defined in `src/constants/storage.ts`.

```
sobagi-user                    → UserState
sobagi-expenses                → Expense[]
sobagi-last-emotion            → SobagiEmotion

sobagi-mailbox-delivered-ids   → string[]
sobagi-found-item-ids          → string[]
sobagi-pending-item-id         → string | null
sobagi-staged-item-id          → string | null
sobagi-last-item-date          → string (YYYY-MM-DD)  cooldown for found item staging
sobagi-last-bag-open-days      → number               for new-item dot
sobagi-last-visit-date         → string (YYYY-MM-DD)  gap detection
sobagi-observation-save-count  → number               cooldown for observation messages
```

## Known Issues

### Fix required
- **Warmth color mismatch** — `PhotocardView.tsx` line 76: `'#C87941'` → `'#E8C070'`
- **DayFeelingCard future dates** — renders for dates > today; guard `dateStr <= todayStr`
- **Photocard early dismiss** — `onPress` is live from t=0; needs `isRevealing` guard for first 1.8s

### Copy / tone
- `"잘 기록해뒀어요"` (Tier 1 happy pool) — "잘" borderline against evaluation anti-pattern
- `"오늘도 수고했어요"` (IDLE_MESSAGES) — "수고했어요" evaluates effort; replace with observational

### UX gaps
- Emotion picker missing `(선택)` label
- Trend graph bars not tappable
- Photocard quote `fontStyle: italic` reads as formal caption; recommend removing

### Long-term pacing
- Floating hearts on every record — charming at #1, performative by #30
- Dialogue tier transitions are hard thresholds — tone shifts abruptly at day 7 and day 30
- Settlement section bold monetary totals compete with emotional identity

### Technical
- Pre-existing TS error in `_404.tsx` — not blocking, not recently introduced
- Android keyboard behavior in record.tsx unverified

## Architecture Reference

**Stack:** React Native 0.84 · React 19 · TypeScript 5.8 (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`) · Zustand 5 · Granite SDK 1.0.25

**Stores:** `useEmotionStore` (emotion, message) · `useExpenseStore` (expenses[]) · `useUserStore` (level, streak, recordedDaysCount, roomStage)

**Services:** `storageService` · `expenseService` · `emotionEngine` · `dayFeelingService` · `foundItemService` · `atmosphereService` · `dialogueService` · `letterService`

**Routes:** `/` · `/record` · `/reaction` · `/stats`

**Build:** `npm run dev` / `npm run build` / `npm run clean` / `npm test` / `npm run typecheck`

**Assets:** jsDelivr CDN, pinned to git SHA. All maps `Partial<Record<...>>` — fallback required everywhere.

For full architecture: see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Progression Reference

**Metric:** `recordedDaysCount` — distinct local calendar days with ≥ 1 expense. Recomputed from full expense array on every app init.

| Level | Days | Progression anchor |
|---|---|---|
| Lv.1 | 0 | Day one |
| Lv.2 | 7 | Dialogue tier 2; first found item fires; warmth first perceptible |
| Lv.3 | 20 | — |
| Lv.4 | 40 | — |
| Lv.5 | 70 | — |
| Lv.6 | 110 | Warmth noticeable |
| Lv.7 | 160 | — |

Dialogue tier 3 activates at day 30. Warmth ceiling (0.06 opacity) at day 90.
Thresholds are slow — no reward for binging, only for consistent presence.
